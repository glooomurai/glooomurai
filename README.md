The name's **Floyd**, **Idia** or just **Parasite**. I'll answer to whatever ya choose to Call me tho. I'm an **artist** sometimes, a **writer** when I feel like it, a **poet** whenever The time comes and nothing but a dead corpse most of the time. Not in the mood for friends or chit-chat Rn, if ya See me Around people i'm prolly just hanging out with **Loveine**.

I've got this typing Quirk where I be randomly capitalizing some words, I tryna avoid it sometimes but be Aware in case I feel like Talking to ya.

**DNI if ya ain't Azul Ashengrotto, Kenma Kozume or Il Dottore.** _Lovie's allowed here as well, i Guess..._ ( ï¿£-ï¿£)

#### The Disgusting Truth;

I like a lot of medias, not hiperfixated on anything specific **Atm**, but I enjoy topics such as *artistic Expressions*, *deep Sea creatures* and *microscopic organisms*, also **Vampires**, **death** and **ghosts**, everything creepy is Beautiful and morbid topics like rot, death and Cannibalism are sweet. _Horror about mental hospitals, lobotomy and hallucinations is my Favorite kind._

I hope it's needless to say, I Love _the ugly_, _the Fearsome_ and _the horrific_. But I also know how to Enjoy the cute, playful and Adorable sometimes! some medias I love talking about are **Fran Bow**, **DHMIS**, **Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu**, **House MD**, **Ordem Paranormal**, **Repo the Genetic Opera**, **TWST** and **IWTV**.

I also love children's shows like **Chiikawa**, **kid vampire** and **Cardcaptor Sakura**. I also really like *videogames* and *animanga* like **ganbare! Nakamura-kun**, **Saiki kusuo**, **Undertale**, **Deltarune**, **Enstars**, **mob Psycho 100**, **Death Note**, **YnM** and **Haikyuu**!! I *mostly* read yaoi, But i also enjoy some *yuri* and *hetero* couples. Both healthy and unhealthy.

#### The Self-Centered Freak;
I've got some specific headcanons I'm **not willing to Give up on**, my faves are, mostly, all *agender* or Just *unlabeled*, I use **any pronouns** and **Neopronouns** for them as well. 

i'm a **monoshipper** For some specific characters. _(non-toxic, But i might get a lil annoyed at Ya at first if It's anything revolving Azul.)_

I am Azul Ashengrotto's one and true lover and Tartaglia's real Brother. I'm both Floyd Leech and Idia Shroud IRL. Sometimes more Floyd or more Idia, sometimes I achieve some clarity And become normal. **Floazu & Idiazu 5ever** <3
