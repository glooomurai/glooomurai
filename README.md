#### The Zombified Delusion;

The name's **Floyd**, **Idia** or just **Parasite**. I'll answer to whatever ya choose to call me tho. I'm an **artist** sometimes, a **writer** when I feel like it, a **poet** whenever the time comes and nothing but a dead corpse most of the time. Not in the mood for friends or chit-chat Rn, if ya see me around people i'm prolly just hanging out with **Loveine**.

I've got this typing Quirk where I be randomly capitalizing some words, I tryna avoid it here but be Aware in case I feel like Talking to ya.

**DNI if you're not Azul Ashengrotto, Divus Crewel or Il Dottore.** _Lovie is allowed too ig..._

#### The Disgusting Truth;

I like a lot of medias, not hiperfixated on anything specific atm, but I enjoy topics such as deep sea creatures and microscopic organisms, also vampires, death and ghosts, everything creepy is beautiful and morbid topics like rot, death and cannibalism are sweet.

Horror about mental hospitals, lobotomy and hallucinations is my favorite. Hope it's needless to say, I love the ugly, the fearsome and the horrific, I love fran bow, hikaru ga shinda natsu, paranormal order, interview with the vampire and some found footage horror movies. 

But I also know how to enjoy the cute and adorable sometimes! I love children's shows like chiikawa, kid vampire and sakura cardcaptor. I also really like rhythm games and haikyuu!! I mostly read yaoi, but i also enjoy yuri and hetero couples. Both healthy and unhealthy.

#### The Self-Centered Freak;
I am Azul Ashengrotto's one and true lover and Tartaglia's real brother. I'm both Floyd Leech and Idia Shroud IRL. Sometimes more Floyd or more Idia, sometimes I achieve some clarity and become normal. I dont have a proper diagnosis, but there's something really wrong with me besides the autism and agoraphobia.
