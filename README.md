The name's **Floyd**, **Idia** or just **Parasite**. I'll answer to whatever ya choose to Call me tho. I'm an **artist** sometimes, a **writer** when I feel like it, a **poet** whenever The time comes and nothing but a dead corpse most of the time. Not in the mood for friends or chit-chat Rn, if ya See me Around people i'm prolly just hanging out with **Loveine**.

I've got this typing Quirk where I be randomly capitalizing some words, I tryna avoid it sometimes but be Aware in case I feel like Talking to ya.

**DNI if you're not Azul Ashengrotto, Kenma Kozume or Il Dottore.** _Lovie's allowed here as well, i Guess..._ ( ï¿£-ï¿£)

#### The Disgusting Truth;

I like a lot of medias, not hiperfixated on anything specific Atm, but I enjoy topics such as *deep Sea creatures* and *microscopic organisms*, also Vampires, death and ghosts, everything creepy is Beautiful and morbid topics like rot, death and Cannibalism are sweet.

Horror about mental hospitals, lobotomy and hallucinations is my Favorite. I hope it's needless to say, I Love the ugly, the fearsome and the horrific. I love **Fran Bow**, **DHMIS**, **Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu**, **Ordem Paranormal**, **RTGO**, **IWTV** and some *found footage horror movies*. 

But I also know how to enjoy the cute and adorable sometimes! I love children's shows like **Chiikawa**, **kid vampire** and **sakura cardcaptor**. I also really like *rhythm games*, **ganbare! Nakamura-kun**, **Saiki kusuo**, **Undertale**, **Deltarune**, **TWST** **mob Psycho 100** and **Haikyuu**!! I *mostly* read yaoi, But i also enjoy *yuri* and *hetero* couples. Both healthy and unhealthy.

#### The Self-Centered Freak;
I am Azul Ashengrotto's one and true lover and Tartaglia's real brother. I'm both Floyd Leech and Idia Shroud IRL. Sometimes more Floyd or more Idia, sometimes I achieve some clarity and become normal. I dont have a proper diagnosis, but there's something really wrong with me besides the **autism** and **agoraphobia**. (the autism Is diagnosed for Ya nosy mF.) I've got those Weird mood shifts i Can't control properly, Beware before interacting.
